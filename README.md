# Youtube-Video-Downloader
Simple Youtube video downloader. Can use FFMPEG to download higher quality videos.
Just place ffmpeg.exe into the same directory, has multithreading capabilities (Fast Download button)
but this has a maximum quality of 720p. The amount of threads can be incremented and decremented (click the
"Change thread count" checkbox), and the download folder is saved in preferences.json.
